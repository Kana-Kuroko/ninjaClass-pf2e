These proficiencies are noted at the start of the class section.</p>\n<h2>Shinobi's Mark</h2>\n<p>You mark a single creature that you can see for death, causing all your melee Strikes with a one-handed agile or finesse weapon to deal an additional 3 precision damage to the target. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to Seek your @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.e56c8G151bF6996G]{Shinobi's Mark} target.</p>\n<p>You can only have one @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.e56c8G151bF6996G]{Shinobi's Mark} target at a time. A creature is always aware that they have been marked for death, although they may not be aware of your exact location. Designating a creature your Shinobi&rsquo;s Mark target is an obviously hostile action, and the creature remains marked until it dies, or you spend 10 minutes to recenter yourself and prepare to pursue a new target. You can also Refocus while preparing to hunt a new target.</p>\n<p>As your level increases, so does the additional damage from your @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.e56c8G151bF6996G]{Shinobi's Mark}. Increase the additional damage you deal on a melee Strike by 3 at your 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.</p>\n<h2>Shinobi Clan</h2>\n<p>There are several well known ninja clans, each with their own training regimes and specialties. You may be a dedicated trainee of a specific clan and work with the main organization or received training from a branch of the clan and left to pursue your own form of training and development. The clan you received training from will shape how you approach a target, &nbsp;and how your abilities will grow over time. While the various clans can work together if the situation calls for it, and are not opposed to swelling their numbers with new trainees, they will jealously guard their innermost secrets and always seek to punish those who abscond with the clan&rsquo;s most treasured knowledge. The available clans are as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Koka Clan<br></strong>The Koka are unrivaled as spies and masters of stealth, and it is not unheard of for a high profile assassination to be attributed to the clan. Their training also relies heavily on deception and subterfuge, making them peerless at information gathering and sabotage. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to all Stealth and Deception checks against the target of your Shinobi&rsquo;s Mark, as well as a +2 circumstance bonus to any Recall Knowledge checks made against your marked target. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-actions.tQGUqq0Hncy7AJVK]{Shadow's Intuition} action.<strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Igarashi Clan</strong><br>The Igarashi clan specialize in warfare of all kinds and are no strangers to open combat, making them an effective addition to any fighting force and fearful bodyguards alike. Due to their militant training, it is almost impossible to catch an Igarashi ninja without some kind of weapon to defend themselves with. You don&rsquo;t suffer the usual -2 circumstance penalty when using an improvised weapon, and you deal the bonus damage from your Shinobi&rsquo;s Mark with any melee weapon, as long as the weapon&rsquo;s damage die is equal to or smaller than a d8 (after calculating any changes to the weapon&rsquo;s damage die size). You also become trained in medium armor, which likewise increases in proficiency whenever your light armor and unarmored defense would increase. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-actions.2D3RNJ7jilVBT1bu]{Marked Strike} action.</p>\n<p><strong>Hakone Clan</strong><br>Member of the Hakone clan have long sought to explore their mystic arts, always seeking a deeper understanding, and placing a greater emphasis on their training with ninjutsu. You become trained in Occultism. Choose three cantrips from the following: Dancing Lights, Detect Magic, Ghost Sound, Guidance, Light, Message, Prestidigitation, or Read Aura. You gain access to the Cast a Spell activity and your choice of cantrips as innate Occult spells. Whenever the target of your Shinobi&rsquo;s Mark attempts to Cast a Spell, you can use your reaction to make an Occultism check to attempt to Recall Knowledge and identify the spell. Increase your focus pool by 1 Focus Point. You gain access to the @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-actions.rNYtCqzupzXDHHYJ]{Cursed Casting} activity.</p>\n<h2>Ninjutsu</h2>\n<p>Ninjutsu are the mystic arts developed and honed by the various ninja clans and come in a wide array of abilities and techniques that have been passed down through generations. Each technique is created in conjunction with somatic gestures, meant to symbolize a concept or creature of power to lend strength to the spell. Ninjutsu techniques are a type of focus spell. It takes 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your Focus Points during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes performing the Refocus activity, usually by meditating on your mission or direct goals. You learn the @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-spells.MorppNwSmBQt1H77]{Shruiken Storm} and @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-spells.piU2BgUAE4K3N2Je]{Swift as Shadow} ninjutsu techniques.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level, rounded up. Focus spells don&rsquo;t require spell slots and can&rsquo;t be cast using spell slots. Taking certain feats can increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool, although your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. The full rules for focus spells can be found in Chapter 7 of the Pathfinder 2nd Edition Core Rulebook. Unlike most other focus spells, the DC for any ninjutsu technique is equal to your class DC, rather than a spellcasting DC.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ninja feats</h2>\n<p>At 1st level and every even-number level, you gain a ninja class feat.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3td level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Skill Increase<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this to either become trained in a skill you are untrained in, or become an expert in a skill you are trained in.</p>\n<p>At 7th level you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill you are an expert in, and at 15th level you can use them to become legendary in a skill that you are already a master.</p>\n<h2>Surprise Attack<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>You act before your foes can react. On the first round of combat, whenever you roll Stealth or Deception for initiative, creatures that haven&rsquo;t acted yet are flat-footed to your Strikes.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these boosts to increase an ability score above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it is 18 or higher already, or by 2 if it is below 18.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Test text saving field.</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"uncommon","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.794,"lastMigration":null},"keyAbility":{"value":["dex","str"]},"items":{"vgT0a":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.e56c8G151bF6996G","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/gravitational-pull.webp","name":"Shinobi's Mark","level":1},"6tqNY":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.0mAQr9KOrSRdQJYo","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/disapperance.webp","name":"Ninjutsu","level":1},"r9luJ":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.Gn5mNleRgE94et1d","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/weapon-expertise.webp","name":"Weapon Expertise","level":5},"K5gnF":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.vsgdUdX6jc65fNbc","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/evasion.webp","name":"Evasion","level":7},"bXcwC":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.wJzgURkP7mofxvYD","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/vigilant-senses.webp","name":"Vigilant Senses","level":7},"j5II4":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.xzJk5y8SHU41KBmh","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/weapon-specialization.webp","name":"Weapon Specialization","level":7},"Yt1js":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.01VwQ2VLj7x5hcym","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/blade-barrier.webp","name":"Assassinate","level":9},"Y3ymu":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.1FrU9jSqKlDThpGB","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/iron-will.webp","name":"Iron Will","level":11},"0iVee":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.aPn8KeIM63UOW2wS","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/light-armor-expertise.webp","name":"Light Armor Expertise","level":13},"IdMsD":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.2ut4f3zTSguVMZKM","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/improved-evasion.webp","name":"Improved Evasion","level":13},"lg26S":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.PLbl11Q4I0WlZkUX","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/weapon-mastery.webp","name":"Weapon Mastery","level":13},"PK2zF":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.QSPhBYNL1o1skWK6","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/incredible-sense.webp","name":"Incredible Senses","level":13},"ZeMkj":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.EOobfk7PpCH1khwh","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/greater-weapon-specialization.webp","name":"Greater Weapon Specialization","level":15},"2MBzl":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.qqp3erK3lelE6T2D","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/juggerenaut.webp","name":"Juggernaut","level":15},"jR2Rw":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.QviEu5CdjXqhfArq","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/shadow-jump.webp","name":"Master Assassin","level":17},"xljyq":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.IRvtJyuHyA28OPei","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/light-armor-master.webp","name":"Light Armor Mastery","level":19},"moKGO":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.1K0umeaHHkdKpYLn","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/isolation.webp","name":"Erase Presence","level":19},"XMPQu":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.WcyvJMpgr7fwoXUZ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/empty-inside.webp","name":"Shinobi Clan","level":1},"3B8Gn":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.TcZjJGgr6FKUVy33","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/invisibility.webp","name":"Ninja Expertise","level":9},"1UyuN":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.9hyzJ1qnvPhZa188","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/possession.webp","name":"Ninja Mastery","level":17},"2y5pi":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.R5xaiEjDGzvHFwHN","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/surprice-attack.webp","name":"Surprise Attack","level":3}},"hp":8,"trainedSkills":{"value":["ste"],"additional":4,"custom":""},"perception":2,"savingThrows":{"fortitude":2,"reflex":2,"will":1},"attacks":{"simple":1,"martial":1,"advanced":0,"unarmed":1,"other":{"name":"","rank":0}},"defenses":{"unarmored":1,"light":1,"medium":0,"heavy":0},"classDC":1,"ancestryFeatLevels":{"value":[1,5,9,13,17]},"classFeatLevels":{"value":[1,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"generalFeatLevels":{"value":[3,7,11,15,19]},"skillFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"skillIncreaseLevels":{"value":[3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/class.svg","effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"ChAfHXWjGQIj5GUP":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.BN9EwmnbKmgEsV6o"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.2.6","coreVersion":"10.287","createdTime":1676937121167,"modifiedTime":1682784364725,"lastModifiedBy":"ChAfHXWjGQIj5GUP"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"Z2lWCx5aDOZWr8Hf"}

These proficiencies are noted at the start of the class section.</p>\n<h2>Shinobi's Mark</h2>\n<p>You mark a single creature that you can see for death, causing all your melee Strikes with a one-handed agile or finesse weapon to deal an additional 3 precision damage to the target.

A creature is always aware that they have been marked for death, although they may not be aware of your exact location. Designating a creature your Shinobi&rsquo;s Mark target is an obviously hostile action, and the creature remains marked until it dies, or you spend 10 minutes to recenter yourself and prepare to pursue a new target. You can also Refocus while preparing to hunt a new target.</p>\n<p>As your level increases, so does the additional damage from your @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.e56c8G151bF6996G]{Shinobi's Mark}. Increase the additional damage you deal on a melee Strike by 3 at your 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.</p>\n<h2>Shinobi Clan</h2>\n<p>There are several well known ninja clans, each with their own training regimes and specialties. You may be a dedicated trainee of a specific clan and work with the main organization or received training from a branch of the clan and left to pursue your own form of training and development. The clan you received training from will shape how you approach a target, &nbsp;and how your abilities will grow over time. While the various clans can work together if the situation calls for it, and are not opposed to swelling their numbers with new trainees, they will jealously guard their innermost secrets and always seek to punish those who abscond with the clan&rsquo;s most treasured knowledge. The available clans are as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Koka Clan<br></strong>The Koka are unrivaled as spies and masters of stealth, and it is not unheard of for a high profile assassination to be attributed to the clan. Their training also relies heavily on deception and subterfuge, making them peerless at information gathering and sabotage. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to all Stealth and Deception checks against the target of your Shinobi&rsquo;s Mark, as well as a +2 circumstance bonus to any Recall Knowledge checks made against your marked target. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-actions.tQGUqq0Hncy7AJVK]{Shadow's Intuition} action.<strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Igarashi Clan</strong><br>The Igarashi clan specialize in warfare of all kinds and are no strangers to open combat, making them an effective addition to any fighting force and fearful bodyguards alike. Due to their militant training, it is almost impossible to catch an Igarashi ninja without some kind of weapon to defend themselves with. You don&rsquo;t suffer the usual -2 circumstance penalty when using an improvised weapon, and you deal the bonus damage from your Shinobi&rsquo;s Mark with any melee weapon, as long as the weapon&rsquo;s damage die is equal to or smaller than a d8 (after calculating any changes to the weapon&rsquo;s damage die size). You also become trained in medium armor, which likewise increases in proficiency whenever your light armor and unarmored defense would increase. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-actions.2D3RNJ7jilVBT1bu]{Marked Strike} action.</p>\n<p><strong>Hakone Clan</strong><br>Member of the Hakone clan have long sought to explore their mystic arts, always seeking a deeper understanding, and placing a greater emphasis on their training with ninjutsu. You become trained in Occultism. Choose three cantrips from the following: Dancing Lights, Detect Magic, Ghost Sound, Guidance, Light, Message, Prestidigitation, or Read Aura. You gain access to the Cast a Spell activity and your choice of cantrips as innate Occult spells. Whenever the target of your Shinobi&rsquo;s Mark attempts to Cast a Spell, you can use your reaction to make an Occultism check to attempt to Recall Knowledge and identify the spell. Increase your focus pool by 1 Focus Point. You gain access to the @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-actions.rNYtCqzupzXDHHYJ]{Cursed Casting} activity.</p>\n<h2>Ninjutsu</h2>\n<p>Ninjutsu are the mystic arts developed and honed by the various ninja clans and come in a wide array of abilities and techniques that have been passed down through generations. Each technique is created in conjunction with somatic gestures, meant to symbolize a concept or creature of power to lend strength to the spell. Ninjutsu techniques are a type of focus spell. It takes 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your Focus Points during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes performing the Refocus activity, usually by meditating on your mission or direct goals. You learn the @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-spells.MorppNwSmBQt1H77]{Shruiken Storm} and @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-spells.piU2BgUAE4K3N2Je]{Swift as Shadow} ninjutsu techniques.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level, rounded up. Focus spells don&rsquo;t require spell slots and can&rsquo;t be cast using spell slots. Taking certain feats can increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool, although your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. The full rules for focus spells can be found in Chapter 7 of the Pathfinder 2nd Edition Core Rulebook. Unlike most other focus spells, the DC for any ninjutsu technique is equal to your class DC, rather than a spellcasting DC.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ninja feats</h2>\n<p>At 1st level and every even-number level, you gain a ninja class feat.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3td level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Skill Increase<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this to either become trained in a skill you are untrained in, or become an expert in a skill you are trained in.</p>\n<p>At 7th level you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill you are an expert in, and at 15th level you can use them to become legendary in a skill that you are already a master.</p>\n<h2>Surprise Attack<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>You act before your foes can react. On the first round of combat, whenever you roll Stealth or Deception for initiative, creatures that haven&rsquo;t acted yet are flat-footed to your Strikes.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these boosts to increase an ability score above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it is 18 or higher already, or by 2 if it is below 18.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Test text saving field.</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"uncommon","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.794,"lastMigration":null},"keyAbility":{"value":["dex","str"]},"items":{"vgT0a":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.e56c8G151bF6996G","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/gravitational-pull.webp","name":"Shinobi's Mark","level":1},"6tqNY":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.0mAQr9KOrSRdQJYo","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/disapperance.webp","name":"Ninjutsu","level":1},"r9luJ":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.Gn5mNleRgE94et1d","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/weapon-expertise.webp","name":"Weapon Expertise","level":5},"K5gnF":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.vsgdUdX6jc65fNbc","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/evasion.webp","name":"Evasion","level":7},"bXcwC":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.wJzgURkP7mofxvYD","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/vigilant-senses.webp","name":"Vigilant Senses","level":7},"j5II4":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.xzJk5y8SHU41KBmh","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/weapon-specialization.webp","name":"Weapon Specialization","level":7},"Yt1js":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.01VwQ2VLj7x5hcym","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/blade-barrier.webp","name":"Assassinate","level":9},"Y3ymu":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.1FrU9jSqKlDThpGB","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/iron-will.webp","name":"Iron Will","level":11},"0iVee":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.aPn8KeIM63UOW2wS","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/light-armor-expertise.webp","name":"Light Armor Expertise","level":13},"IdMsD":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.2ut4f3zTSguVMZKM","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/improved-evasion.webp","name":"Improved Evasion","level":13},"lg26S":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.PLbl11Q4I0WlZkUX","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/weapon-mastery.webp","name":"Weapon Mastery","level":13},"PK2zF":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.QSPhBYNL1o1skWK6","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/incredible-sense.webp","name":"Incredible Senses","level":13},"ZeMkj":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.EOobfk7PpCH1khwh","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/greater-weapon-specialization.webp","name":"Greater Weapon Specialization","level":15},"2MBzl":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.qqp3erK3lelE6T2D","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/juggerenaut.webp","name":"Juggernaut","level":15},"jR2Rw":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.QviEu5CdjXqhfArq","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/shadow-jump.webp","name":"Master Assassin","level":17},"xljyq":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.IRvtJyuHyA28OPei","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/light-armor-master.webp","name":"Light Armor Mastery","level":19},"moKGO":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.1K0umeaHHkdKpYLn","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/isolation.webp","name":"Erase Presence","level":19},"XMPQu":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.WcyvJMpgr7fwoXUZ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/empty-inside.webp","name":"Shinobi Clan","level":1},"3B8Gn":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.TcZjJGgr6FKUVy33","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/invisibility.webp","name":"Ninja Expertise","level":9},"1UyuN":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.9hyzJ1qnvPhZa188","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/possession.webp","name":"Ninja Mastery","level":17},"2y5pi":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.R5xaiEjDGzvHFwHN","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/surprice-attack.webp","name":"Surprise Attack","level":3}},"hp":8,"trainedSkills":{"value":["ste"],"additional":4,"custom":""},"perception":2,"savingThrows":{"fortitude":2,"reflex":2,"will":1},"attacks":{"simple":1,"martial":1,"advanced":0,"unarmed":1,"other":{"name":"","rank":0}},"defenses":{"unarmored":1,"light":1,"medium":0,"heavy":0},"classDC":1,"ancestryFeatLevels":{"value":[1,5,9,13,17]},"classFeatLevels":{"value":[1,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"generalFeatLevels":{"value":[3,7,11,15,19]},"skillFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"skillIncreaseLevels":{"value":[3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/class.svg","effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"ChAfHXWjGQIj5GUP":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.BN9EwmnbKmgEsV6o"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.2.6","coreVersion":"10.287","createdTime":1676937121167,"modifiedTime":1682784501276,"lastModifiedBy":"ChAfHXWjGQIj5GUP"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"Z2lWCx5aDOZWr8Hf"}

These proficiencies are noted at the start of the class section.</p>\n<h2>Shinobi's Mark</h2>\n<p>You mark a single creature that you can see for death, causing all your melee Strikes with a one-handed agile or finesse weapon to deal an additional 3 precision damage to the target. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to Seek your @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.e56c8G151bF6996G]{Shinobi's Mark} target.</p>\n<p>You can only have one @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.e56c8G151bF6996G]{Shinobi's Mark} target at a time. A creature is always aware that they have been marked for death, although they may not be aware of your exact location. Designating a creature your Shinobi&rsquo;s Mark target is an obviously hostile action, and the creature remains marked until it dies, or you spend 10 minutes to recenter yourself and prepare to pursue a new target. You can also Refocus while preparing to hunt a new target.</p>\n<p>As your level increases, so does the additional damage from your @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.e56c8G151bF6996G]{Shinobi's Mark}. Increase the additional damage you deal on a melee Strike by 3 at your 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.</p>\n<h2>Shinobi Clan</h2>\n<p>There are several well known ninja clans, each with their own training regimes and specialties. You may be a dedicated trainee of a specific clan and work with the main organization or received training from a branch of the clan and left to pursue your own form of training and development. The clan you received training from will shape how you approach a target, &nbsp;and how your abilities will grow over time. While the various clans can work together if the situation calls for it, and are not opposed to swelling their numbers with new trainees, they will jealously guard their innermost secrets and always seek to punish those who abscond with the clan&rsquo;s most treasured knowledge. The available clans are as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Koka Clan<br></strong>The Koka are unrivaled as spies and masters of stealth, and it is not unheard of for a high profile assassination to be attributed to the clan. Their training also relies heavily on deception and subterfuge, making them peerless at information gathering and sabotage. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to all Stealth and Deception checks against the target of your Shinobi&rsquo;s Mark, as well as a +2 circumstance bonus to any Recall Knowledge checks made against your marked target. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-actions.tQGUqq0Hncy7AJVK]{Shadow's Intuition} action.<strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Igarashi Clan</strong><br>The Igarashi clan specialize in warfare of all kinds and are no strangers to open combat, making them an effective addition to any fighting force and fearful bodyguards alike. Due to their militant training, it is almost impossible to catch an Igarashi ninja without some kind of weapon to defend themselves with. You don&rsquo;t suffer the usual -2 circumstance penalty when using an improvised weapon, and you deal the bonus damage from your Shinobi&rsquo;s Mark with any melee weapon, as long as the weapon&rsquo;s damage die is equal to or smaller than a d8 (after calculating any changes to the weapon&rsquo;s damage die size). You also become trained in medium armor, which likewise increases in proficiency whenever your light armor and unarmored defense would increase. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-actions.2D3RNJ7jilVBT1bu]{Marked Strike} action.</p>\n<p><strong>Hakone Clan</strong><br>Member of the Hakone clan have long sought to explore their mystic arts, always seeking a deeper understanding, and placing a greater emphasis on their training with ninjutsu. You become trained in Occultism. Choose three cantrips from the following: Dancing Lights, Detect Magic, Ghost Sound, Guidance, Light, Message, Prestidigitation, or Read Aura. You gain access to the Cast a Spell activity and your choice of cantrips as innate Occult spells. Whenever the target of your Shinobi&rsquo;s Mark attempts to Cast a Spell, you can use your reaction to make an Occultism check to attempt to Recall Knowledge and identify the spell. Increase your focus pool by 1 Focus Point. You gain access to the @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-actions.rNYtCqzupzXDHHYJ]{Cursed Casting} activity.</p>\n<h2>Ninjutsu</h2>\n<p>Ninjutsu are the mystic arts developed and honed by the various ninja clans and come in a wide array of abilities and techniques that have been passed down through generations. Each technique is created in conjunction with somatic gestures, meant to symbolize a concept or creature of power to lend strength to the spell. Ninjutsu techniques are a type of focus spell. It takes 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your Focus Points during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes performing the Refocus activity, usually by meditating on your mission or direct goals. You learn the @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-spells.MorppNwSmBQt1H77]{Shruiken Storm} and @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-spells.piU2BgUAE4K3N2Je]{Swift as Shadow} ninjutsu techniques.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level, rounded up. Focus spells don&rsquo;t require spell slots and can&rsquo;t be cast using spell slots. Taking certain feats can increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool, although your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. The full rules for focus spells can be found in Chapter 7 of the Pathfinder 2nd Edition Core Rulebook. Unlike most other focus spells, the DC for any ninjutsu technique is equal to your class DC, rather than a spellcasting DC.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ninja feats</h2>\n<p>At 1st level and every even-number level, you gain a ninja class feat.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3td level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Skill Increase<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this to either become trained in a skill you are untrained in, or become an expert in a skill you are trained in.</p>\n<p>At 7th level you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill you are an expert in, and at 15th level you can use them to become legendary in a skill that you are already a master.</p>\n<h2>Surprise Attack<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>You act before your foes can react. On the first round of combat, whenever you roll Stealth or Deception for initiative, creatures that haven&rsquo;t acted yet are flat-footed to your Strikes.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these boosts to increase an ability score above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it is 18 or higher already, or by 2 if it is below 18.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You have become familiar with how to use your weapons to execute your targets. You gain expert proficiency in simple and martial weapons, as well as unarmed attacks. Additionally, whenever you critically succeed on a Strike that triggers the additional damage from your Shinobi&rsquo;s Mark, you apply the critical specialization effect of that weapon or unarmed attack.</p>\n<h2>Evasion<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You&rsquo;ve learned to move quickly to avoid explosions, dragon&rsquo;s breath, and worse. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Vigilant Senses<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Throughout your adventures, you&rsquo;ve developed a keen awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You&rsquo;ve learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you are a master, and 4 if you are legendary.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Test text saving field.</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"uncommon","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.794,"lastMigration":null},"keyAbility":{"value":["dex","str"]},"items":{"vgT0a":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.e56c8G151bF6996G","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/gravitational-pull.webp","name":"Shinobi's Mark","level":1},"6tqNY":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.0mAQr9KOrSRdQJYo","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/disapperance.webp","name":"Ninjutsu","level":1},"r9luJ":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.Gn5mNleRgE94et1d","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/weapon-expertise.webp","name":"Weapon Expertise","level":5},"K5gnF":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.vsgdUdX6jc65fNbc","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/evasion.webp","name":"Evasion","level":7},"bXcwC":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.wJzgURkP7mofxvYD","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/vigilant-senses.webp","name":"Vigilant Senses","level":7},"j5II4":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.xzJk5y8SHU41KBmh","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/weapon-specialization.webp","name":"Weapon Specialization","level":7},"Yt1js":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.01VwQ2VLj7x5hcym","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/blade-barrier.webp","name":"Assassinate","level":9},"Y3ymu":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.1FrU9jSqKlDThpGB","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/iron-will.webp","name":"Iron Will","level":11},"0iVee":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.aPn8KeIM63UOW2wS","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/light-armor-expertise.webp","name":"Light Armor Expertise","level":13},"IdMsD":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.2ut4f3zTSguVMZKM","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/improved-evasion.webp","name":"Improved Evasion","level":13},"lg26S":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.PLbl11Q4I0WlZkUX","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/weapon-mastery.webp","name":"Weapon Mastery","level":13},"PK2zF":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.QSPhBYNL1o1skWK6","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/incredible-sense.webp","name":"Incredible Senses","level":13},"ZeMkj":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.EOobfk7PpCH1khwh","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/greater-weapon-specialization.webp","name":"Greater Weapon Specialization","level":15},"2MBzl":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.qqp3erK3lelE6T2D","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/juggerenaut.webp","name":"Juggernaut","level":15},"jR2Rw":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.QviEu5CdjXqhfArq","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/shadow-jump.webp","name":"Master Assassin","level":17},"xljyq":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.IRvtJyuHyA28OPei","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/light-armor-master.webp","name":"Light Armor Mastery","level":19},"moKGO":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.1K0umeaHHkdKpYLn","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/isolation.webp","name":"Erase Presence","level":19},"XMPQu":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.WcyvJMpgr7fwoXUZ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/empty-inside.webp","name":"Shinobi Clan","level":1},"3B8Gn":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.TcZjJGgr6FKUVy33","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/invisibility.webp","name":"Ninja Expertise","level":9},"1UyuN":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.9hyzJ1qnvPhZa188","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/possession.webp","name":"Ninja Mastery","level":17},"2y5pi":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.R5xaiEjDGzvHFwHN","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/surprice-attack.webp","name":"Surprise Attack","level":3}},"hp":8,"trainedSkills":{"value":["ste"],"additional":4,"custom":""},"perception":2,"savingThrows":{"fortitude":2,"reflex":2,"will":1},"attacks":{"simple":1,"martial":1,"advanced":0,"unarmed":1,"other":{"name":"","rank":0}},"defenses":{"unarmored":1,"light":1,"medium":0,"heavy":0},"classDC":1,"ancestryFeatLevels":{"value":[1,5,9,13,17]},"classFeatLevels":{"value":[1,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"generalFeatLevels":{"value":[3,7,11,15,19]},"skillFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"skillIncreaseLevels":{"value":[3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/class.svg","effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"ChAfHXWjGQIj5GUP":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.BN9EwmnbKmgEsV6o"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.2.6","coreVersion":"10.287","createdTime":1676937121167,"modifiedTime":1682784655807,"lastModifiedBy":"ChAfHXWjGQIj5GUP"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"Z2lWCx5aDOZWr8Hf"}

These proficiencies are noted at the start of the class section.</p>\n<h2>Shinobi's Mark</h2>\n<p>You mark a single creature that you can see for death, causing all your melee Strikes with a one-handed agile or finesse weapon to deal an additional 3 precision damage to the target. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to Seek your @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.e56c8G151bF6996G]{Shinobi's Mark} target.</p>\n<p>You can only have one @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.e56c8G151bF6996G]{Shinobi's Mark} target at a time. A creature is always aware that they have been marked for death, although they may not be aware of your exact location. Designating a creature your Shinobi&rsquo;s Mark target is an obviously hostile action, and the creature remains marked until it dies, or you spend 10 minutes to recenter yourself and prepare to pursue a new target. You can also Refocus while preparing to hunt a new target.</p>\n<p>As your level increases, so does the additional damage from your @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.e56c8G151bF6996G]{Shinobi's Mark}. Increase the additional damage you deal on a melee Strike by 3 at your 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.</p>\n<h2>Shinobi Clan</h2>\n<p>There are several well known ninja clans, each with their own training regimes and specialties. You may be a dedicated trainee of a specific clan and work with the main organization or received training from a branch of the clan and left to pursue your own form of training and development. The clan you received training from will shape how you approach a target, &nbsp;and how your abilities will grow over time. While the various clans can work together if the situation calls for it, and are not opposed to swelling their numbers with new trainees, they will jealously guard their innermost secrets and always seek to punish those who abscond with the clan&rsquo;s most treasured knowledge. The available clans are as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Koka Clan<br></strong>The Koka are unrivaled as spies and masters of stealth, and it is not unheard of for a high profile assassination to be attributed to the clan. Their training also relies heavily on deception and subterfuge, making them peerless at information gathering and sabotage. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to all Stealth and Deception checks against the target of your Shinobi&rsquo;s Mark, as well as a +2 circumstance bonus to any Recall Knowledge checks made against your marked target. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-actions.tQGUqq0Hncy7AJVK]{Shadow's Intuition} action.<strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Igarashi Clan</strong><br>The Igarashi clan specialize in warfare of all kinds and are no strangers to open combat, making them an effective addition to any fighting force and fearful bodyguards alike. Due to their militant training, it is almost impossible to catch an Igarashi ninja without some kind of weapon to defend themselves with. You don&rsquo;t suffer the usual -2 circumstance penalty when using an improvised weapon, and you deal the bonus damage from your Shinobi&rsquo;s Mark with any melee weapon, as long as the weapon&rsquo;s damage die is equal to or smaller than a d8 (after calculating any changes to the weapon&rsquo;s damage die size). You also become trained in medium armor, which likewise increases in proficiency whenever your light armor and unarmored defense would increase. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-actions.2D3RNJ7jilVBT1bu]{Marked Strike} action.</p>\n<p><strong>Hakone Clan</strong><br>Member of the Hakone clan have long sought to explore their mystic arts, always seeking a deeper understanding, and placing a greater emphasis on their training with ninjutsu. You become trained in Occultism. Choose three cantrips from the following: Dancing Lights, Detect Magic, Ghost Sound, Guidance, Light, Message, Prestidigitation, or Read Aura. You gain access to the Cast a Spell activity and your choice of cantrips as innate Occult spells. Whenever the target of your Shinobi&rsquo;s Mark attempts to Cast a Spell, you can use your reaction to make an Occultism check to attempt to Recall Knowledge and identify the spell. Increase your focus pool by 1 Focus Point. You gain access to the @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-actions.rNYtCqzupzXDHHYJ]{Cursed Casting} activity.</p>\n<h2>Ninjutsu</h2>\n<p>Ninjutsu are the mystic arts developed and honed by the various ninja clans and come in a wide array of abilities and techniques that have been passed down through generations. Each technique is created in conjunction with somatic gestures, meant to symbolize a concept or creature of power to lend strength to the spell. Ninjutsu techniques are a type of focus spell. It takes 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your Focus Points during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes performing the Refocus activity, usually by meditating on your mission or direct goals. You learn the @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-spells.MorppNwSmBQt1H77]{Shruiken Storm} and @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-spells.piU2BgUAE4K3N2Je]{Swift as Shadow} ninjutsu techniques.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level, rounded up. Focus spells don&rsquo;t require spell slots and can&rsquo;t be cast using spell slots. Taking certain feats can increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool, although your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. The full rules for focus spells can be found in Chapter 7 of the Pathfinder 2nd Edition Core Rulebook. Unlike most other focus spells, the DC for any ninjutsu technique is equal to your class DC, rather than a spellcasting DC.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ninja feats</h2>\n<p>At 1st level and every even-number level, you gain a ninja class feat.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3td level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Skill Increase<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this to either become trained in a skill you are untrained in, or become an expert in a skill you are trained in.</p>\n<p>At 7th level you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill you are an expert in, and at 15th level you can use them to become legendary in a skill that you are already a master.</p>\n<h2>Surprise Attack<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>You act before your foes can react. On the first round of combat, whenever you roll Stealth or Deception for initiative, creatures that haven&rsquo;t acted yet are flat-footed to your Strikes.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these boosts to increase an ability score above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it is 18 or higher already, or by 2 if it is below 18.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You have become familiar with how to use your weapons to execute your targets. You gain expert proficiency in simple and martial weapons, as well as unarmed attacks. Additionally, whenever you critically succeed on a Strike that triggers the additional damage from your Shinobi&rsquo;s Mark, you apply the critical specialization effect of that weapon or unarmed attack.</p>\n<h2>Evasion<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You&rsquo;ve learned to move quickly to avoid explosions, dragon&rsquo;s breath, and worse. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Vigilant Senses<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Throughout your adventures, you&rsquo;ve developed a keen awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You&rsquo;ve learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you are a master, and 4 if you are legendary.</p>\n<h2>Ninja Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your techniques are harder to resist, and you&rsquo;ve developed a deeper skill with your mystic arts. Your proficiency for your ninja class DC increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Assassinate<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You&rsquo;ve learned how to make a precise strike with the intent to kill your target. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-actions.S0zIPxNF2j8PYvQD]{Assassinate} activity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Test text saving field.</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"uncommon","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.794,"lastMigration":null},"keyAbility":{"value":["dex","str"]},"items":{"vgT0a":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.e56c8G151bF6996G","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/gravitational-pull.webp","name":"Shinobi's Mark","level":1},"6tqNY":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.0mAQr9KOrSRdQJYo","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/disapperance.webp","name":"Ninjutsu","level":1},"r9luJ":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.Gn5mNleRgE94et1d","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/weapon-expertise.webp","name":"Weapon Expertise","level":5},"K5gnF":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.vsgdUdX6jc65fNbc","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/evasion.webp","name":"Evasion","level":7},"bXcwC":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.wJzgURkP7mofxvYD","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/vigilant-senses.webp","name":"Vigilant Senses","level":7},"j5II4":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.xzJk5y8SHU41KBmh","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/weapon-specialization.webp","name":"Weapon Specialization","level":7},"Yt1js":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.01VwQ2VLj7x5hcym","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/blade-barrier.webp","name":"Assassinate","level":9},"Y3ymu":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.1FrU9jSqKlDThpGB","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/iron-will.webp","name":"Iron Will","level":11},"0iVee":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.aPn8KeIM63UOW2wS","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/light-armor-expertise.webp","name":"Light Armor Expertise","level":13},"IdMsD":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.2ut4f3zTSguVMZKM","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/improved-evasion.webp","name":"Improved Evasion","level":13},"lg26S":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.PLbl11Q4I0WlZkUX","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/weapon-mastery.webp","name":"Weapon Mastery","level":13},"PK2zF":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.QSPhBYNL1o1skWK6","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/incredible-sense.webp","name":"Incredible Senses","level":13},"ZeMkj":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.EOobfk7PpCH1khwh","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/greater-weapon-specialization.webp","name":"Greater Weapon Specialization","level":15},"2MBzl":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.qqp3erK3lelE6T2D","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/juggerenaut.webp","name":"Juggernaut","level":15},"jR2Rw":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.QviEu5CdjXqhfArq","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/shadow-jump.webp","name":"Master Assassin","level":17},"xljyq":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.IRvtJyuHyA28OPei","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/light-armor-master.webp","name":"Light Armor Mastery","level":19},"moKGO":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.1K0umeaHHkdKpYLn","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/isolation.webp","name":"Erase Presence","level":19},"XMPQu":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.WcyvJMpgr7fwoXUZ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/empty-inside.webp","name":"Shinobi Clan","level":1},"3B8Gn":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.TcZjJGgr6FKUVy33","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/invisibility.webp","name":"Ninja Expertise","level":9},"1UyuN":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.9hyzJ1qnvPhZa188","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/possession.webp","name":"Ninja Mastery","level":17},"2y5pi":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.R5xaiEjDGzvHFwHN","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/surprice-attack.webp","name":"Surprise Attack","level":3}},"hp":8,"trainedSkills":{"value":["ste"],"additional":4,"custom":""},"perception":2,"savingThrows":{"fortitude":2,"reflex":2,"will":1},"attacks":{"simple":1,"martial":1,"advanced":0,"unarmed":1,"other":{"name":"","rank":0}},"defenses":{"unarmored":1,"light":1,"medium":0,"heavy":0},"classDC":1,"ancestryFeatLevels":{"value":[1,5,9,13,17]},"classFeatLevels":{"value":[1,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"generalFeatLevels":{"value":[3,7,11,15,19]},"skillFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"skillIncreaseLevels":{"value":[3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/class.svg","effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"ChAfHXWjGQIj5GUP":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.BN9EwmnbKmgEsV6o"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.2.6","coreVersion":"10.287","createdTime":1676937121167,"modifiedTime":1682784722876,"lastModifiedBy":"ChAfHXWjGQIj5GUP"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"Z2lWCx5aDOZWr8Hf"}

These proficiencies are noted at the start of the class section.</p>\n<h2>Shinobi's Mark</h2>\n<p>You mark a single creature that you can see for death, causing all your melee Strikes with a one-handed agile or finesse weapon to deal an additional 3 precision damage to the target. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to Seek your @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.e56c8G151bF6996G]{Shinobi's Mark} target.</p>\n<p>You can only have one @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.e56c8G151bF6996G]{Shinobi's Mark} target at a time. A creature is always aware that they have been marked for death, although they may not be aware of your exact location. Designating a creature your Shinobi&rsquo;s Mark target is an obviously hostile action, and the creature remains marked until it dies, or you spend 10 minutes to recenter yourself and prepare to pursue a new target. You can also Refocus while preparing to hunt a new target.</p>\n<p>As your level increases, so does the additional damage from your @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.e56c8G151bF6996G]{Shinobi's Mark}. Increase the additional damage you deal on a melee Strike by 3 at your 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.</p>\n<h2>Shinobi Clan</h2>\n<p>There are several well known ninja clans, each with their own training regimes and specialties. You may be a dedicated trainee of a specific clan and work with the main organization or received training from a branch of the clan and left to pursue your own form of training and development. The clan you received training from will shape how you approach a target, &nbsp;and how your abilities will grow over time. While the various clans can work together if the situation calls for it, and are not opposed to swelling their numbers with new trainees, they will jealously guard their innermost secrets and always seek to punish those who abscond with the clan&rsquo;s most treasured knowledge. The available clans are as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Koka Clan<br></strong>The Koka are unrivaled as spies and masters of stealth, and it is not unheard of for a high profile assassination to be attributed to the clan. Their training also relies heavily on deception and subterfuge, making them peerless at information gathering and sabotage. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to all Stealth and Deception checks against the target of your Shinobi&rsquo;s Mark, as well as a +2 circumstance bonus to any Recall Knowledge checks made against your marked target. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-actions.tQGUqq0Hncy7AJVK]{Shadow's Intuition} action.<strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Igarashi Clan</strong><br>The Igarashi clan specialize in warfare of all kinds and are no strangers to open combat, making them an effective addition to any fighting force and fearful bodyguards alike. Due to their militant training, it is almost impossible to catch an Igarashi ninja without some kind of weapon to defend themselves with. You don&rsquo;t suffer the usual -2 circumstance penalty when using an improvised weapon, and you deal the bonus damage from your Shinobi&rsquo;s Mark with any melee weapon, as long as the weapon&rsquo;s damage die is equal to or smaller than a d8 (after calculating any changes to the weapon&rsquo;s damage die size). You also become trained in medium armor, which likewise increases in proficiency whenever your light armor and unarmored defense would increase. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-actions.2D3RNJ7jilVBT1bu]{Marked Strike} action.</p>\n<p><strong>Hakone Clan</strong><br>Member of the Hakone clan have long sought to explore their mystic arts, always seeking a deeper understanding, and placing a greater emphasis on their training with ninjutsu. You become trained in Occultism. Choose three cantrips from the following: Dancing Lights, Detect Magic, Ghost Sound, Guidance, Light, Message, Prestidigitation, or Read Aura. You gain access to the Cast a Spell activity and your choice of cantrips as innate Occult spells. Whenever the target of your Shinobi&rsquo;s Mark attempts to Cast a Spell, you can use your reaction to make an Occultism check to attempt to Recall Knowledge and identify the spell. Increase your focus pool by 1 Focus Point. You gain access to the @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-actions.rNYtCqzupzXDHHYJ]{Cursed Casting} activity.</p>\n<h2>Ninjutsu</h2>\n<p>Ninjutsu are the mystic arts developed and honed by the various ninja clans and come in a wide array of abilities and techniques that have been passed down through generations. Each technique is created in conjunction with somatic gestures, meant to symbolize a concept or creature of power to lend strength to the spell. Ninjutsu techniques are a type of focus spell. It takes 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your Focus Points during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes performing the Refocus activity, usually by meditating on your mission or direct goals. You learn the @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-spells.MorppNwSmBQt1H77]{Shruiken Storm} and @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-spells.piU2BgUAE4K3N2Je]{Swift as Shadow} ninjutsu techniques.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level, rounded up. Focus spells don&rsquo;t require spell slots and can&rsquo;t be cast using spell slots. Taking certain feats can increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool, although your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. The full rules for focus spells can be found in Chapter 7 of the Pathfinder 2nd Edition Core Rulebook. Unlike most other focus spells, the DC for any ninjutsu technique is equal to your class DC, rather than a spellcasting DC.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ninja feats</h2>\n<p>At 1st level and every even-number level, you gain a ninja class feat.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3td level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Skill Increase<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this to either become trained in a skill you are untrained in, or become an expert in a skill you are trained in.</p>\n<p>At 7th level you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill you are an expert in, and at 15th level you can use them to become legendary in a skill that you are already a master.</p>\n<h2>Surprise Attack<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>You act before your foes can react. On the first round of combat, whenever you roll Stealth or Deception for initiative, creatures that haven&rsquo;t acted yet are flat-footed to your Strikes.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these boosts to increase an ability score above 18. Boosting an ability score increases it by 1 if it is 18 or higher already, or by 2 if it is below 18.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>You have become familiar with how to use your weapons to execute your targets. You gain expert proficiency in simple and martial weapons, as well as unarmed attacks. Additionally, whenever you critically succeed on a Strike that triggers the additional damage from your Shinobi&rsquo;s Mark, you apply the critical specialization effect of that weapon or unarmed attack.</p>\n<h2>Evasion<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You&rsquo;ve learned to move quickly to avoid explosions, dragon&rsquo;s breath, and worse. Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Reflex save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Vigilant Senses<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>Throughout your adventures, you&rsquo;ve developed a keen awareness and attention to detail. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You&rsquo;ve learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you are a master, and 4 if you are legendary.</p>\n<h2>Ninja Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your techniques are harder to resist, and you&rsquo;ve developed a deeper skill with your mystic arts. Your proficiency for your ninja class DC increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Assassinate<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You&rsquo;ve learned how to make a precise strike with the intent to kill your target. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-actions.S0zIPxNF2j8PYvQD]{Assassinate} activity.</p>\n<h2>Iron Will<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>Your mental defenses are an iron fortress. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Light Armor Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You&rsquo;ve learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor. Your proficiency ranks for light armor and unarmored defense increase to expert.</p>\n<h2>Improved Evasion<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>Your ability to elude danger is matchless. Your proficiency rank in Reflex saves increases to legendary. When you roll a critical failure on a Reflex save, you get a normal failure instead. When you roll a failure on a Reflex save, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Incredible Senses<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You notice things almost impossible for an ordinary person to detect. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Mastery<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You&rsquo;ve mastered a ninja&rsquo;s fighting style. Your proficiency with simple and martial weapons, along with unarmed attacks, increases to master.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Test text saving field.</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"uncommon","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.794,"lastMigration":null},"keyAbility":{"value":["dex","str"]},"items":{"vgT0a":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.e56c8G151bF6996G","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/gravitational-pull.webp","name":"Shinobi's Mark","level":1},"6tqNY":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.0mAQr9KOrSRdQJYo","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/disapperance.webp","name":"Ninjutsu","level":1},"r9luJ":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.Gn5mNleRgE94et1d","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/weapon-expertise.webp","name":"Weapon Expertise","level":5},"K5gnF":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.vsgdUdX6jc65fNbc","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/evasion.webp","name":"Evasion","level":7},"bXcwC":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.wJzgURkP7mofxvYD","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/vigilant-senses.webp","name":"Vigilant Senses","level":7},"j5II4":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.xzJk5y8SHU41KBmh","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/weapon-specialization.webp","name":"Weapon Specialization","level":7},"Yt1js":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.01VwQ2VLj7x5hcym","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/blade-barrier.webp","name":"Assassinate","level":9},"Y3ymu":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.1FrU9jSqKlDThpGB","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/iron-will.webp","name":"Iron Will","level":11},"0iVee":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.aPn8KeIM63UOW2wS","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/light-armor-expertise.webp","name":"Light Armor Expertise","level":13},"IdMsD":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.2ut4f3zTSguVMZKM","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/improved-evasion.webp","name":"Improved Evasion","level":13},"lg26S":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.PLbl11Q4I0WlZkUX","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/weapon-mastery.webp","name":"Weapon Mastery","level":13},"PK2zF":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.QSPhBYNL1o1skWK6","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/incredible-sense.webp","name":"Incredible Senses","level":13},"ZeMkj":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.EOobfk7PpCH1khwh","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/greater-weapon-specialization.webp","name":"Greater Weapon Specialization","level":15},"2MBzl":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.qqp3erK3lelE6T2D","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/juggerenaut.webp","name":"Juggernaut","level":15},"jR2Rw":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.QviEu5CdjXqhfArq","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/shadow-jump.webp","name":"Master Assassin","level":17},"xljyq":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.IRvtJyuHyA28OPei","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/light-armor-master.webp","name":"Light Armor Mastery","level":19},"moKGO":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.1K0umeaHHkdKpYLn","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/isolation.webp","name":"Erase Presence","level":19},"XMPQu":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.WcyvJMpgr7fwoXUZ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/empty-inside.webp","name":"Shinobi Clan","level":1},"3B8Gn":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.TcZjJGgr6FKUVy33","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/invisibility.webp","name":"Ninja Expertise","level":9},"1UyuN":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.9hyzJ1qnvPhZa188","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/possession.webp","name":"Ninja Mastery","level":17},"2y5pi":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.R5xaiEjDGzvHFwHN","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/surprice-attack.webp","name":"Surprise Attack","level":3}},"hp":8,"trainedSkills":{"value":["ste"],"additional":4,"custom":""},"perception":2,"savingThrows":{"fortitude":2,"reflex":2,"will":1},"attacks":{"simple":1,"martial":1,"advanced":0,"unarmed":1,"other":{"name":"","rank":0}},"defenses":{"unarmored":1,"light":1,"medium":0,"heavy":0},"classDC":1,"ancestryFeatLevels":{"value":[1,5,9,13,17]},"classFeatLevels":{"value":[1,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"generalFeatLevels":{"value":[3,7,11,15,19]},"skillFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"skillIncreaseLevels":{"value":[3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/class.svg","effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"ChAfHXWjGQIj5GUP":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.BN9EwmnbKmgEsV6o"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.2.6","coreVersion":"10.287","createdTime":1676937121167,"modifiedTime":1682784878449,"lastModifiedBy":"ChAfHXWjGQIj5GUP"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"Z2lWCx5aDOZWr8Hf"}

These proficiencies are noted at the start of the class section.</p>\n<h2>Shinobi's Mark</h2>\n<p>You mark a single creature that you can see for death, causing all your melee Strikes with a one-handed agile or finesse weapon to deal an additional 3 precision damage to the target. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to Seek your @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.e56c8G151bF6996G]{Shinobi's Mark} target.</p>\n<p>You can only have one @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.e56c8G151bF6996G]{Shinobi's Mark} target at a time. A creature is always aware that they have been marked for death, although they may not be aware of your exact location. Designating a creature your Shinobi&rsquo;s Mark target is an obviously hostile action, and the creature remains marked until it dies, or you spend 10 minutes to recenter yourself and prepare to pursue a new target. You can also Refocus while preparing to hunt a new target.</p>\n<p>As your level increases, so does the additional damage from your @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.e56c8G151bF6996G]{Shinobi's Mark}. Increase the additional damage you deal on a melee Strike by 3 at your 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.</p>\n<h2>Shinobi Clan</h2>\n<p>There are several well known ninja clans, each with their own training regimes and specialties. You may be a dedicated trainee of a specific clan and work with the main organization or received training from a branch of the clan and left to pursue your own form of training and development. The clan you received training from will shape how you approach a target, &nbsp;and how your abilities will grow over time. While the various clans can work together if the situation calls for it, and are not opposed to swelling their numbers with new trainees, they will jealously guard their innermost secrets and always seek to punish those who abscond with the clan&rsquo;s most treasured knowledge. The available clans are as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Koka Clan<br></strong>The Koka are unrivaled as spies and masters of stealth, and it is not unheard of for a high profile assassination to be attributed to the clan. Their training also relies heavily on deception and subterfuge, making them peerless at information gathering and sabotage. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to all Stealth and Deception checks against the target of your Shinobi&rsquo;s Mark, as well as a +2 circumstance bonus to any Recall Knowledge checks made against your marked target. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-actions.tQGUqq0Hncy7AJVK]{Shadow's Intuition} action.<strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Igarashi Clan</strong><br>The Igarashi clan specialize in warfare of all kinds and are no strangers to open combat, making them an effective addition to any fighting force and fearful bodyguards alike. Due to their militant training, it is almost impossible to catch an Igarashi ninja without some kind of weapon to defend themselves with. You don&rsquo;t suffer the usual -2 circumstance penalty when using an improvised weapon, and you deal the bonus damage from your Shinobi&rsquo;s Mark with any melee weapon, as long as the weapon&rsquo;s damage die is equal to or smaller than a d8 (after calculating any changes to the weapon&rsquo;s damage die size). You also become trained in medium armor, which likewise increases in proficiency whenever your light armor and unarmored defense would increase. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-actions.2D3RNJ7jilVBT1bu]{Marked Strike} action.</p>\n<p><strong>Hakone Clan</strong><br>Member of the Hakone clan have long sought to explore their mystic arts, always seeking a deeper understanding, and placing a greater emphasis on their training with ninjutsu. You become trained in Occultism. Choose three cantrips from the following: Dancing Lights, Detect Magic, Ghost Sound, Guidance, Light, Message, Prestidigitation, or Read Aura. You gain access to the Cast a Spell activity and your choice of cantrips as innate Occult spells. Whenever the target of your Shinobi&rsquo;s Mark attempts to Cast a Spell, you can use your reaction to make an Occultism check to attempt to Recall Knowledge and identify the spell. Increase your focus pool by 1 Focus Point. You gain access to the @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-actions.rNYtCqzupzXDHHYJ]{Cursed Casting} activity.</p>\n<h2>Ninjutsu</h2>\n<p>Ninjutsu are the mystic arts developed and honed by the various ninja clans and come in a wide array of abilities and techniques that have been passed down through generations. Each technique is created in conjunction with somatic gestures, meant to symbolize a concept or creature of power to lend strength to the spell. Ninjutsu techniques are a type of focus spell. It takes 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your Focus Points during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes performing the Refocus activity, usually by meditating on your mission or direct goals. You learn the @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-spells.MorppNwSmBQt1H77]{Shruiken Storm} and @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-spells.piU2BgUAE4K3N2Je]{Swift as Shadow} ninjutsu techniques.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level, rounded up. Focus spells don&rsquo;t require spell slots and can&rsquo;t be cast using spell slots. Taking certain feats can increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool, although your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. The full rules for focus spells can be found in Chapter 7 of the Pathfinder 2nd Edition Core Rulebook. Unlike most other focus spells, the DC for any ninjutsu technique is equal to your class DC, rather than a spellcasting DC.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ninja feats</h2>\n<p>At 1st level and every even-number level, you gain a ninja class feat.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat. You must be trained or better in the corresponding skill to select a skill feat.</p>\n<h2>General Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3td level and every 4 levels thereafter, you gain a general feat.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Skill Increase<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>At 3rd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill increase. You can use this to either become trained in a skill you are untrained in, or become an expert in a skill you are trained in.</p>\n<p>At 7th level you can use skill increases to become a master in a skill you are an expert in, and at 15th level you can use them to become legendary in a skill that you are already a master.</p>\n<h2>Surprise Attack<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 3</span></h2>\n<p>You act before your foes can react. On the first round of combat, whenever you roll Stealth or Deception for initiative, creatures that haven&rsquo;t acted yet are flat-footed to your Strikes.</p>\n<h2>Ability Boosts<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 5</span></h2>\n<p>At 5th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you boost four different ability scores. You can use these boosts to increase an ability score above 18.

Your proficiency rank for Reflex saves increases to master.

Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 7</span></h2>\n<p>You&rsquo;ve learned how to inflict greater injuries with the weapons you know best. You deal 2 additional damage with weapons and unarmed attacks in which you are an expert. This damage increases to 3 if you are a master, and 4 if you are legendary.</p>\n<h2>Ninja Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your techniques are harder to resist, and you&rsquo;ve developed a deeper skill with your mystic arts. Your proficiency for your ninja class DC increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Assassinate<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You&rsquo;ve learned how to make a precise strike with the intent to kill your target. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-actions.S0zIPxNF2j8PYvQD]{Assassinate} activity.</p>\n<h2>Iron Will<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 11</span></h2>\n<p>Your mental defenses are an iron fortress. Your proficiency rank for Will saves increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Light Armor Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You&rsquo;ve learned how to dodge while wearing light or no armor.

Your proficiency rank in Reflex saves increases to legendary. When you roll a critical failure on a Reflex save, you get a normal failure instead. When you roll a failure on a Reflex save, you take half damage.</p>\n<h2>Incredible Senses<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You notice things almost impossible for an ordinary person to detect. Your proficiency rank for Perception increases to legendary.</p>\n<h2>Weapon Mastery<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 13</span></h2>\n<p>You&rsquo;ve mastered a ninja&rsquo;s fighting style. Your proficiency with simple and martial weapons, along with unarmed attacks, increases to master.</p>\n<h2>Juggernaut<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your body is accustomed to physical hardship and resistant to ailments. Your proficiency rank in Fortitude saves increases to master. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save, you get a critical success instead.</p>\n<h2>Greater Weapon Specialization<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 15</span></h2>\n<p>Your damage from weapon specialization increases to 4 with weapons and unarmed attacks with which you are an expert, 6 if you&rsquo;re a master, and 8 if you&rsquo;re legendary.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Master Assassin<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>The bonus damage from Assassinate increases to 5d6, and you can use Assassinate once per hour.</p>\n<h2>Ninja Mastery<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 17</span></h2>\n<p>You&rsquo;ve mastered the ninja&rsquo;s mystic arts. Your proficiency in ninja class DC increases to master.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Test text saving field.</p>"},"source":{"value":""},"traits":{"value":[],"rarity":"uncommon","custom":""},"rules":[],"slug":null,"schema":{"version":0.794,"lastMigration":null},"keyAbility":{"value":["dex","str"]},"items":{"vgT0a":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.e56c8G151bF6996G","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/gravitational-pull.webp","name":"Shinobi's Mark","level":1},"6tqNY":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.0mAQr9KOrSRdQJYo","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/disapperance.webp","name":"Ninjutsu","level":1},"r9luJ":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.Gn5mNleRgE94et1d","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/weapon-expertise.webp","name":"Weapon Expertise","level":5},"K5gnF":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.vsgdUdX6jc65fNbc","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/evasion.webp","name":"Evasion","level":7},"bXcwC":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.wJzgURkP7mofxvYD","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/vigilant-senses.webp","name":"Vigilant Senses","level":7},"j5II4":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.xzJk5y8SHU41KBmh","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/weapon-specialization.webp","name":"Weapon Specialization","level":7},"Yt1js":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.01VwQ2VLj7x5hcym","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/blade-barrier.webp","name":"Assassinate","level":9},"Y3ymu":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.1FrU9jSqKlDThpGB","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/iron-will.webp","name":"Iron Will","level":11},"0iVee":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.aPn8KeIM63UOW2wS","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/light-armor-expertise.webp","name":"Light Armor Expertise","level":13},"IdMsD":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.2ut4f3zTSguVMZKM","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/improved-evasion.webp","name":"Improved Evasion","level":13},"lg26S":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.PLbl11Q4I0WlZkUX","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/weapon-mastery.webp","name":"Weapon Mastery","level":13},"PK2zF":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.QSPhBYNL1o1skWK6","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/incredible-sense.webp","name":"Incredible Senses","level":13},"ZeMkj":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.EOobfk7PpCH1khwh","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/greater-weapon-specialization.webp","name":"Greater Weapon Specialization","level":15},"2MBzl":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.qqp3erK3lelE6T2D","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/juggerenaut.webp","name":"Juggernaut","level":15},"jR2Rw":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.QviEu5CdjXqhfArq","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/shadow-jump.webp","name":"Master Assassin","level":17},"xljyq":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.IRvtJyuHyA28OPei","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/light-armor-master.webp","name":"Light Armor Mastery","level":19},"moKGO":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.1K0umeaHHkdKpYLn","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/isolation.webp","name":"Erase Presence","level":19},"XMPQu":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.WcyvJMpgr7fwoXUZ","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/empty-inside.webp","name":"Shinobi Clan","level":1},"3B8Gn":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.TcZjJGgr6FKUVy33","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/invisibility.webp","name":"Ninja Expertise","level":9},"1UyuN":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.9hyzJ1qnvPhZa188","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/spells/possession.webp","name":"Ninja Mastery","level":17},"2y5pi":{"uuid":"Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.R5xaiEjDGzvHFwHN","img":"systems/pf2e/icons/features/classes/surprice-attack.webp","name":"Surprise Attack","level":3}},"hp":8,"trainedSkills":{"value":["ste"],"additional":4,"custom":""},"perception":2,"savingThrows":{"fortitude":2,"reflex":2,"will":1},"attacks":{"simple":1,"martial":1,"advanced":0,"unarmed":1,"other":{"name":"","rank":0}},"defenses":{"unarmored":1,"light":1,"medium":0,"heavy":0},"classDC":1,"ancestryFeatLevels":{"value":[1,5,9,13,17]},"classFeatLevels":{"value":[1,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"generalFeatLevels":{"value":[3,7,11,15,19]},"skillFeatLevels":{"value":[2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20]},"skillIncreaseLevels":{"value":[3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19]}},"img":"systems/pf2e/icons/default-icons/class.svg","effects":[],"ownership":{"default":0,"ChAfHXWjGQIj5GUP":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Item.BN9EwmnbKmgEsV6o"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.2.6","coreVersion":"10.287","createdTime":1676937121167,"modifiedTime":1682784995395,"lastModifiedBy":"ChAfHXWjGQIj5GUP"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"Z2lWCx5aDOZWr8Hf"}

These proficiencies are noted at the start of the class section.</p>\n<h2>Shinobi's Mark</h2>\n<p>You mark a single creature that you can see for death, causing all your melee Strikes with a one-handed agile or finesse weapon to deal an additional 3 precision damage to the target. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to Seek your @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.e56c8G151bF6996G]{Shinobi's Mark} target.</p>\n<p>You can only have one @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.e56c8G151bF6996G]{Shinobi's Mark} target at a time. A creature is always aware that they have been marked for death, although they may not be aware of your exact location. Designating a creature your Shinobi&rsquo;s Mark target is an obviously hostile action, and the creature remains marked until it dies, or you spend 10 minutes to recenter yourself and prepare to pursue a new target. You can also Refocus while preparing to hunt a new target.</p>\n<p>As your level increases, so does the additional damage from your @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-classfeatures.e56c8G151bF6996G]{Shinobi's Mark}. Increase the additional damage you deal on a melee Strike by 3 at your 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.</p>\n<h2>Shinobi Clan</h2>\n<p>There are several well known ninja clans, each with their own training regimes and specialties. You may be a dedicated trainee of a specific clan and work with the main organization or received training from a branch of the clan and left to pursue your own form of training and development. The clan you received training from will shape how you approach a target, &nbsp;and how your abilities will grow over time. While the various clans can work together if the situation calls for it, and are not opposed to swelling their numbers with new trainees, they will jealously guard their innermost secrets and always seek to punish those who abscond with the clan&rsquo;s most treasured knowledge. The available clans are as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Koka Clan<br></strong>The Koka are unrivaled as spies and masters of stealth, and it is not unheard of for a high profile assassination to be attributed to the clan. Their training also relies heavily on deception and subterfuge, making them peerless at information gathering and sabotage. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to all Stealth and Deception checks against the target of your Shinobi&rsquo;s Mark, as well as a +2 circumstance bonus to any Recall Knowledge checks made against your marked target. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-actions.tQGUqq0Hncy7AJVK]{Shadow's Intuition} action.<strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Igarashi Clan</strong><br>The Igarashi clan specialize in warfare of all kinds and are no strangers to open combat, making them an effective addition to any fighting force and fearful bodyguards alike. Due to their militant training, it is almost impossible to catch an Igarashi ninja without some kind of weapon to defend themselves with. You don&rsquo;t suffer the usual -2 circumstance penalty when using an improvised weapon, and you deal the bonus damage from your Shinobi&rsquo;s Mark with any melee weapon, as long as the weapon&rsquo;s damage die is equal to or smaller than a d8 (after calculating any changes to the weapon&rsquo;s damage die size). You also become trained in medium armor, which likewise increases in proficiency whenever your light armor and unarmored defense would increase. You gain the @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-actions.2D3RNJ7jilVBT1bu]{Marked Strike} action.</p>\n<p><strong>Hakone Clan</strong><br>Member of the Hakone clan have long sought to explore their mystic arts, always seeking a deeper understanding, and placing a greater emphasis on their training with ninjutsu. You become trained in Occultism. Choose three cantrips from the following: Dancing Lights, Detect Magic, Ghost Sound, Guidance, Light, Message, Prestidigitation, or Read Aura. You gain access to the Cast a Spell activity and your choice of cantrips as innate Occult spells. Whenever the target of your Shinobi&rsquo;s Mark attempts to Cast a Spell, you can use your reaction to make an Occultism check to attempt to Recall Knowledge and identify the spell. Increase your focus pool by 1 Focus Point. You gain access to the @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-actions.rNYtCqzupzXDHHYJ]{Cursed Casting} activity.</p>\n<h2>Ninjutsu</h2>\n<p>Ninjutsu are the mystic arts developed and honed by the various ninja clans and come in a wide array of abilities and techniques that have been passed down through generations. Each technique is created in conjunction with somatic gestures, meant to symbolize a concept or creature of power to lend strength to the spell. Ninjutsu techniques are a type of focus spell. It takes 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell, and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your Focus Points during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes performing the Refocus activity, usually by meditating on your mission or direct goals. You learn the @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-spells.MorppNwSmBQt1H77]{Shruiken Storm} and @UUID[Compendium.ninja.ninja-spells.piU2BgUAE4K3N2Je]{Swift as Shadow} ninjutsu techniques.</p>\n<p>Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level, rounded up. Focus spells don&rsquo;t require spell slots and can&rsquo;t be cast using spell slots. Taking certain feats can increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool, although your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points. The full rules for focus spells can be found in Chapter 7 of the Pathfinder 2nd Edition Core Rulebook. Unlike most other focus spells, the DC for any ninjutsu technique is equal to your class DC, rather than a spellcasting DC.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Ninja feats</h2>\n<p>At 1st level and every even-number level, you gain a ninja class feat.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Skill Feats<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 2</span></h2>\n<p>At 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter, you gain a skill feat.

This damage increases to 3 if you are a master, and 4 if you are legendary.</p>\n<h2>Ninja Expertise<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>Your techniques are harder to resist, and you&rsquo;ve developed a deeper skill with your mystic arts. Your proficiency for your ninja class DC increases to expert.</p>\n<h2>Assassinate<span style=\"float: right;\">Level 9</span></h2>\n<p>You&rsquo;ve learned how to make a precise strike with the intent to kill your target.

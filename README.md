Shinobi's Mark applies to all strike damage, due to an issue with getting replacements to work for both the Igarashi clan benefits and the Lethal Aim feat. Please keep an eye on your weapon choice and make sure you have a valid weapon equiped before checking the box to trigger the bonus damage from Shinobi's Mark.

Focus spells are not automatically added to your list when the appropriate feat is taken. You will need to open the feat and drag the linked spell from within to your focus spell list. 

While the ninja class DC will increase automatically when you gain the appropriate class feature, this change isn't properly updated in the Foundry module when you set class DC as the scaling for your focus spells. You will need to manually increase your proficiency on the spellcasting page to expert at level 9 and master at level 17.
